A broken bear model is hidden under a metal panel here. Parts of it are missing, mainly its claws, as if someone salvaged weapons from it, not unlike how you did from the deer. The powerful magnets it uses in its paws to pick up and hurl scrap are still present. You retrieve the magnets and incorporate them into your weapon.
